# Vaccine-Usage-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
The data set is the response of people to the H1N1 flu vaccine related questionnaire. The respondents are people of age 6 months and older. This survey was designed to monitor the influenza immunization coverage in 2009-10 season.

Machine learning techniques may aid a more efficient analysis in the prediction of how likely the people are to opt for the flu vaccine. In this case study, we predict, how likely it is that the people will take a H1N1 flu vaccine.

This is a binary classification problem hence we have used Logistic Regression Algorithm in this case. We have also tried to boost our results using Stochastic Gradient Descent optimization technique.
